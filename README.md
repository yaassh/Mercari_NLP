## Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge

### Can you automatically suggest product prices to online sellers?
Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.

Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.

In this competition, Mercari’s challenging you to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. You’ll be provided user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.

### Dataset Features
ID: the id of the listing
Name: the title of the listing
Item Condition: the condition of the items provided by the seller
Category Name: category of the listing
Brand Name: brand of the listing
Shipping: whether or not shipping cost was provided
Item Description: the full description of the item
Price: the price that the item was sold for. This is the target variable that you will predict. The unit is USD.

### Work on supply and demand
